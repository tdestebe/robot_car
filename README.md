## Smart robot car avoiding obstacles
This project aims to describe steps to build an autonomous robot car able to avoid obstacles. First step is the creation of a 3D model designed with [freeCAD] (https://www.freecadweb.org) in addition to the beta module [Assembly 2] (https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_assembly2) for assembly. Most of parts will be printed on a 3D printer [Dagoma](https://dagoma.fr) DiscoEasy200.
The 3D CAD files are stored into freeCAD_Models repository.
